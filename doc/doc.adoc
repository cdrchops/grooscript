== Conversion

For convert groovy code to javascript, that groovy code is compiled. Then javascript code is generated
visiting generated AST tree. You can try link:conversions.html[online] conversions at grooscript site. In the
source of the project you can take a look at all the groovy code that is converted to javascript in tests,
you have full scope of all supported features in a lot of
https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript/tree/master/src/test/resources[groovy scripts]

You usually will convert files with groovy code to a destination folder or js file. To be dynamic and automatize
conversion process I strongly recommend to use https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-gradle-plugin[grooscript gradle plugin].
You can activate a daemon to automatically convert groovy code when files are modified.

=== Options

To help or improve conversion process, you can set some conversion options when you convert groovy code. There is an
enum with available conversion options:

[source,groovy]
--
include::../src/main/groovy/org/grooscript/convert/ConversionOptions.groovy[tags=options]
--

== Tools

Grooscript itself is just a Java/Groovy library. We have created some tools to improve the experience using it, in your
http://gradle.org/[Gradle] projects, using it in http://grails.org/[Grails] 2 or 3, in http://nodejs.org/[Node.js] projects or
adding javascript lib dependencies with http://bower.io/[Bower].

=== Gradle plugin

We are working to make good integration with gradle. See the getting started link:starting_gradle.html[guide] to start
working with grooscript. Later you will discover more advanced features, as convert groovy templates or tell your
server that some files have changed. Source on https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-gradle-plugin[github]. See in
gradle plugin http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.grooscript.conversion[repository].

=== Grails plugin

There is an available http://grails.org/plugin/grooscript[plugin] for grails 2.4 with nice features, like use your domain
classes in the client, websocket support or put groovy code in your gsp's that will be run in javascript. Take a look
at the link:grails-plugin/index.html[documentation] for more info. Github https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grails-grooscript[source code].

Also, it exists a Grails 3 plugin, you can take a look at http://grooscript.org/grails3-plugin/[documentation] or source code in https://github.com/chiquitinxx/grooscript-grails3-plugin[github]

=== Npm package

If you have a Node.js project, and you want to use some converted code, you can use grooscript npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/grooscript[package], that will include `grooscript.js`, then your converted code will run.

[source,javascript]
--
var gs = require('grooscript');

eval(fs.readFileSync('aConvertedFile.js')+'');
--

Little link:nodejs_example.html[guide]

=== Bower package

You can add grooscript libs using http://bower.io/[Bower] with `>bower install grooscript`, Then you can add grooscript.js,
grooscript.min.js or grooscript-html-builder.js dependencies in your project.

[source,javascript]
--
<script src="bower_components/grooscript/src/main/resources/grooscript.js"></script>
